# tic-tac-toe-solver

Why have a DRY tic tac toe solver when you can check every single one of the 19'683 board states with a if statement individually? 

See the [generated script](./tictactoe_bot.ts).

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
